Feature: Circles 
  In order to explore Cucumber and Ruby
  As a programmer
  I want to be able to use ruby for circle arithmetic

  Scenario: creating a circle
    Given a circle A with radius 1
    And a circle B with radius 8
    Then I can assert that A has radius 1
    And I can assert that B has radius 8
