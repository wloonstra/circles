Notes:

Scala
==> Tuples, fixed-length lisst with heterogeneous types, val person = ("Piet", "Hein"); Person._1
==> Ranges, 0 until 10, 0 to 10, 0 to 10 by 5, 10 to 0 by -1
==> Companion Objects
object (singleton) and class (normal class)
You can define the 'static methods' (java) in the object and put 
the instance methods (normal methods) in the class.
==> Trait, interface + implementation
